# Hex-Cell-Holder
A parametric OpenSCAD  project to generate models of hexagonal lithium cell holders, boxes, and caps.

hex_cell.scad is the main file to generate holders, boxes, and caps. Modify the configuration for your needs.
fit_test.scad generates holders to test fit which size to use for the holders.

Bat files are added to quickly generate multiple stls.
